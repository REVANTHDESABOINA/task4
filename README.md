Logistic Regression Binary Classifier
Objective
To build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is benign (B) or malignant (M) based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Tools Used
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Dataset
The dataset (data.csv) contains diagnostic measurements of breast cancer cases. The diagnosis column is the target, with:

M = Malignant
B = Benign
Steps Performed
Data loading and preprocessing
Train-test split and feature standardization
Model training using Logistic Regression
Model evaluation using:
Confusion Matrix
Precision
Recall
ROC-AUC
Threshold tuning and sigmoid function explanation
How to Run
Open the logistic_regression_classifier.py and run
